# LAMA Shop

LAMA Shop is an e-commerce fashion store built from a YouTube tutorial by Lama Dev. By leveraging Wix Headless CMS for content and product management, I focused on building a responsive, user-friendly shopping experience. Along the way, I gained an understanding of the architecture behind an E-commerce application and how to use a product-based CMS like Wix SDK. I refined my skills in creating dynamic and fast server actions, complex state logic (for product options and the shopping cart), as well as implementing user journey optimization.
